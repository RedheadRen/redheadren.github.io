                    <h2>A little about me.</h2>
                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>My home is in the PNW, Washington sepcifically, with my small family. I'm a redhead with two boys and an amazingly
                           supportive husband that I will be forever grateful for. My journey into tech started with a pandemic. I'm sure I am 
                           not alone in this, but having been a stay-at-home mom for the previous 4 years, I knew it was time to start something 
                           new. I've been following Skillcrush for years, and the downtime I have due to the now-infamous virus has given me the 
                           time I need to focus on it. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>I was immediately hooked afer going through their free coding bootcamp and wanted to learn all the 
                           things immediately. That curiosity has opened a door that I'm certain will never be shut. Learning how to build my first 
                           website, I've realized I have found something that gives me freedom & versatility I've been looking for in my work and 
                           home life. Now I've made a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my organizational skills and eye for 
                           detail to write clean, elegant code.</p>

                        <h3>Hand-coded HTML</h3>
                        <p>My focus is writing clean, well-formated, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to
                            read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot, and accessible.</p>

                        <h3>Well-Oranized CSS</h3>
                        <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load,
                            and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>

                        <h3>Ease Converting Designs into Code</h3>
                        <p>You can trust me to take a designer's PSD and quickly & accurately convert it into a webpage that is pixel-perfect
                            match.</p>
